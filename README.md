# webScraper
I programmed a web scraper to collect specific sets of data from websites. I tested it will nature.com. Programmed using Python 3.
It is set to scrape articles from a website by targeting specific bits of HTML code. I utilized the Beautiful Soup package to parse the HTML documents.
I used the requests library to send requests and recieve information.
